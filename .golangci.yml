# Adding this config file to work around a false positive reported by GolangCI-Lint
# It is incorrectly flagging missing types in reference to embedded structs
# Our CNI NetConfig embeds types.NetConf from github.com/containernetworking/cni/pkg/types
# The fields of the embedded struct - IPAM, CNIVersion, DNS, etc. are being flagged as undefined
# I think this is our issue: https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/issues/826
# We can remove this config file if fixed in a future version of GolangCI-Lint

issues:
  exclude-rules:
    - path: internal/cni/cni.go

# TODO - temp workaround to allow merging of configFile.go. Remove when config and CDQ are merged
    - path: internal/deviceplugin/configFile.go
      text: "is unused"
